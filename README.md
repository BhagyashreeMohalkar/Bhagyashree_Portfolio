# Frontend Developer Portfolio

This is a modern, interactive portfolio website built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

## 🚀 Getting Started in VS Code

Follow these steps to run this project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 18 or higher recommended).
- **VS Code**: The recommended code editor.

### Installation

1.  **Unzip/Clone** the project folder and open it in VS Code.
2.  Open a terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+` `)`.
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Project

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev:client
```

> **Note:** We use `npm run dev:client` because this is a standalone frontend project. The standard `npm run dev` script in this template is configured for a full-stack Replit environment which you don't need locally.

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the port shown in your terminal) to see the website.
